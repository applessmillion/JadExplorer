### Alert text variables. 
# Just define a value for alert_text and the alert will display.
	$alert_title = "NOTICE";
	$alert_text = "mySQL user has had most of it's access revoked. Searching, along with some other things, may be broken.";

## Alert box customization. Colors yay!
	$webpage_alert_border_color = "#7F0000";							//Alert border color. Prefer a darker color than the bg
	$webpage_alert_bg_color = "#FF5E5E";								//Alert bg color. Should be ligher color, cuz text is black.

## Other variables are located in the vars.php file.
