<center><h4>Welcome to BenWorks!</h4></center>
BenWorks is an inventory management tool to keep pages on each asset added through our system.
There are two types of assets that can be added - computer-related assets and audio-visual assets.
Each of the creation pages offer unique options for each type of asset, and allow for it to be accessed
through our search tools.
Asset pages can be modified and updated at any time, in hopes to keep these records as up to date as possible.
Each page also offers searching SpiceWorks for the asset, allowing for easy discovery of the devices through that tool.
